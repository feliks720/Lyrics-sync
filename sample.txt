Been friends since 1995
Growing up, same street, you, me, my ride or die (my ride or die)
All the years they would grow us apart, yeah
Moved away, but you're still in my heart, yeah
Call you up, how you been?
Can we play in rewind?
Yeah, those other guys you choose
They don't care, no, like I do
I've been waiting on you, oh-whoa
I've been waiting on you for so long (for so long)
And it's killing me to see you there with a broken heart
If you knew I've been waiting on you, oh-whoa
Yeah, I've been waiting on-
You come in like a wrecking ball (wrecking ball)
Crying on me, saying how they make you feel so small (feel so small)
In the rain, could it get any clearer?
I'm the one holding up all your mirrors baby
Hurry up back to me, why'd you ever move on? Yeah
Yeah, you're making me confused
I'm the one that you should choose
I've been waiting on you, oh-whoa
I've been waiting on you for so long (for so long)
And it's killing me to see you there with a broken heart
If you knew I've been waiting on you, oh-whoa
Yeah, I've been waiting on you, whoa
I've been waiting on you, whoa
I've been waiting on you, whoa
I've been waiting on you, whoa
I've been waiting on
